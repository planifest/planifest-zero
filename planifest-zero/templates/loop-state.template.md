# Loop State: {{loop-id}}

> Path: `plan/current/loop-state-{loop-id}.md`. Git-tracked, and committed after
> every update so iteration counters survive interrupt/resume. Resume convention:
> see `pause.template.md`. While a loop-state file has `status: active`, the
> ratchet hook is armed for `plan/current/` artifact writes.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Loop id | `{{discovery_completeness \| verify_by_execution}}` |
| Owning phase | `{{P1–P4}}` |
| Toggle level | `{{report-only \| on}}` |
| Iteration | `{{n}}` of cap `{{3 (default); the P4 self-correct loop keeps 5}}` |
| Last decision | `{{continue \| done \| escalate}}` |
| Last updated | `{{ISO-8601 UTC}}` |

## Run Log

Append-only: one record per iteration. Never rewrite a prior record.

### Iteration {{n}} ({{ISO-8601 UTC}})
- **Action:** {{what the loop did this iteration}}
- **Observation:** {{what was found/measured, findings, check results, evidence}}
- **Decision:** {{continue | done | escalate}}: {{one-line reason}}

---

## Escalation Context

Populated only when `status: escalated`.

- **Stop rule hit:** {{iteration cap | no-progress (same finding 2 consecutive iterations)}}
- **Outstanding gap/finding:** {{exact statement}}
- **What was attempted:** {{summary across iterations}}
- **Recommended next step:** {{for the human}}
