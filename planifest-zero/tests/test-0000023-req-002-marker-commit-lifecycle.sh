# marker commit lifecycle.

# Covers: session markers (plan/.orchestrator-active, plan/.orchestrator-ack,
# plan/.run-mode) must be committed at the point they are written (discovery),
# and the ship phase must clear them, stage the deletions, and confirm with
# git ls-files that none remain tracked.
