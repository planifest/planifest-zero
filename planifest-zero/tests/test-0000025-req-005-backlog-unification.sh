# Tests for feature 0000025, req-005: backlog unification for deferred items.
#
# Confirms:
#   1. planifest-zero/templates/backlog-entry.template.md carries the
#      "Deferral source" field distinguishing discovered mid-flight,
#      deliberate scope decision, and tech debt.
#   2. Backlog mechanics (monotonic id sequence, pull-in/leave/discard
#      pickup) live in the orchestrator's discovery text.
#   3. Subagent out-of-scope filing routes through
#      standards/agent-dispatch-standards.md with a pre-assigned id.
