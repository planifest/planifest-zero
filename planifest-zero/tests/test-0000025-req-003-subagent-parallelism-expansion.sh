# Tests for feature 0000025, req-003: subagent parallelism expansion.
#
# Confirms:
#   1. agent-dispatch-standards.md's MUST-parallelise table has rows for
#      (a) independent new-test-file authoring closing a coverage gap and
#      (b) independent living-doc edits with no shared content.
#   2. The validate-and-accept phase skill keeps its own parallelism
#      guidance (batching and hard sequencing) per the phase-skill
#      parallelism convention.
#   3. None of the pre-existing MUST/Cannot-parallelise rows were removed.
#
# Checks the canonical tracked skill source (planifest-zero/skills/),
# not the gitignored .claude/skills/ runtime sync copy.
