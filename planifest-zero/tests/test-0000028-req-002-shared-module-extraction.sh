# Tests for feature 0000028, req-002: extract duplicated hook logic into a
# shared module under hooks/enforcement/ (ADR-002), sequenced so no caller ever
# imports a module absent from the same commit (ADR-004).
#
# Scope after feature 0000033 removed telemetry: hooks/telemetry/ is gone, and
# with it read-product-id.mjs, record-telemetry-failure.mjs, get-flag-path.mjs,
# emit-event.mjs and phase-enum.mjs. The one shared module req-002 left behind
# is hooks/enforcement/read-stdin.mjs, so this suite covers that module and its
# six real importers.
#
# Covers:
#   1. readStdin has exactly one definition left in hooks/.
#   2. The shared module exists and every importer takes it by relative path.
#   3. The shared readStdin settles on a stdin stream error rather than
#      hanging, and every importer still exits 0 on that path (NFR-001). This is
#      the deliberate behaviour change req-002 calls out: before extraction
#      most per-hook copies wired no stdin.on("error", reject).
#   4. Placement: the always-installed hooks/enforcement/ tree holds everything
#      an enforcement hook imports, so no enforcement hook reaches outside it.
#   5. The install glob copies the shared module, verified by running setup.sh
#      into a scratch workspace with no flags and invoking an installed hook.
