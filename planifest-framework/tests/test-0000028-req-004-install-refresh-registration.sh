# REQ-004 asserts an operational outcome: after a refresh, the phase telemetry
# hooks are registered and telemetry receipts stay out of version control.
#
# The live-firing half of that outcome belongs to REQ-005 and cannot be
# asserted here. A hook firing requires a real host tool session, which is
# exactly why backlog 0000058 existed and why its evidence lives in
# plan/current/verification-report.md rather than in this file. What IS
# assertable without a live session is covered below: that setup.sh contains
# the wiring, that the shared modules reach every install tier, and that the
# receipts path is ignored by git.
