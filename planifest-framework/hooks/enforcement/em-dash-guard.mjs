/**
 * PreToolUse hook: em dash write-time guard (REQ-006, ADR-003, feature 0000028).
 *
 * Rejects the em dash character (U+2014) in content being written to Planifest
 * prose artifacts. Sibling to gate-write.mjs and ratchet-check.mjs in this
 * directory, not a modification of either — a defect here never disables them.
 *
 * Receives: JSON on stdin conforming to the Planifest common envelope (ADR-002)
 * or the raw Claude Code PreToolUse hook input. Reads tool_input.content
 * (Write) or tool_input.new_string (Edit) only — never the existing file on
 * disk, and never the wider repo. Only the write being made right now is
 * scanned, matching the commit-msg precedent of inspecting only what is being
 * committed right now.
 *
 * Scope: plan/current/, docs/, planifest-framework/skills/,
 * planifest-framework/templates/, planifest-framework/standards/. Everything
 * else, including plan/_archive/, plan/changelog/, source code, and this
 * hook's own source and test fixtures under planifest-framework/hooks/ and
 * planifest-framework/tests/, passes without inspection: those paths simply
 * fall outside the five prefixes above, so the guard's own fixtures can
 * contain the character it is designed to catch without needing a bypass.
 *
 * Bypass: a single-line sentinel comment, <!-- planifest-em-dash-allow -->,
 * present anywhere in the content being written, allows that write through
 * regardless of em dash matches. Reusable, not single-use, and writable by
 * either a human or an agent — unlike plan/current/.ratchet-approve, which is
 * human-only and single-use. An em dash carries no weakening semantics (it is
 * a style rule about one character, not a commitment being relaxed), so there
 * is nothing here that needs a human-only, single-use marker. See ADR-003 and
 * planifest-framework/standards/formatting-standards.md for the full
 * rationale.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = pass, 2 = block (matching gate-write.mjs and ratchet-check.mjs).
 * Silent on unexpected errors — always exit 0 on non-enforcement failures (ADR-005).
